# Piano_chord_quiz
Source Code for android app, "Piano Chord Anki".
This is an app where user can interactively learn piano chords.
App can be installed from here "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.first_app.pianochordquiz&hl=ja".
I am more than happy to hear any recommendation to further improve this app.
